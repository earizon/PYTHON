BºJupyterº
  - web application,  server-client structure which is free, open-source, and easy to use.
    Its name is a reference to three core programming languages supported by Jupyter:
    Julia, Python, and R. But Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages!

 - next generation JupyterLab launched in 2018.
   It is a web-based IDE for data science.

 - Interactive output
 - You can create great notebooks containing visualizations, markdown
   text explanations, even Latex equations!
 - It brings the terminal, text editor, console, and file directory view "toghether".
   with a flexible layout.
 - magic commands and notebook extensions augment the functionalities. Ex:
   auto-formatting, debugging, autosave, auto code completion, ...
   There is even a zen mode extension to minimize distractions and maximize productivity!

 - notebooks can be exported to pdf, .py, slides, ...!!!

 - bqplot (https://github.com/bqplot/bqplot) [charts]
   2-D visualization system for Jupyter, based on the constructs of the Grammar of Graphics.

Bºjupyterlab-requirementsº
  <https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/19/managing-python-dependencies-with-the-thoth-jupyterlab-extension/>
  JupyterLab extension for dependency management directly from a Jupyter notebook.
  Two resolution engines are available at the moment: Thoth (default) and Pipenv(backup).

BºPyDevº
  - Eclipse based.
  - huge developer community
  - plethora of plugins available
  - Django integration
  - code completion
  - On-the-fly code analysis
  - Refactoring capability
  - Debugger: conditional breakpoints, expression evaluation,
              view the variables in the current stack.
  - Remote debugging capability to debug external programs
  - Interactive console for Python, Jython, and IronPython
  - unit testing capability through unittest, nosetest or pytest
  -BºDjango pre-installedº to develop web-applications
  - the recommended way of using PyDev is by installing LiClipse which
    bundles PyDev along with a lightweight editor.

BºCompletion of Code Extensions for Vim/NeoVimº
  - Recomended for "big projects"
  - CoC allows reusing VisualStudio plugins inside Vim/NeoVim through the Server Language Protocol
  - Coc-Pyright:
    - https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-pyright
      - Commands:
        python.runLinting      : Run linting
        python.sortImports     : Sort imports by isort
        pyright.organizeimports: Organize imports by Pyright
        pyright.restartserver  : forces type checker to discard all cached type information and restart analysis.
                                 It is useful in cases where new type stubs or libraries have been installed.
        pyright.createtypestub : Creates Type Stubs with given module name, for example
                                 :CocCommand pyright.createtypestub numpy

BºSpyderº
  - Scientific Python Development Environment:
    - lightweight, free, and open-source.
  - written 100% in Python.
  - Designed exclusively for data scientists and analysts.
  - very basic interface  all in a single window:
    - text editor
    - file explorer
    - variable explorer:
      - shows variables, functions, modules, etc. of
        the currently selected IPython Console session.
      - It also provides several built-in support for editing objects
        like lists, strings, tuples, etc. along with a really awesome
        feature to display some of them as an image or even a plot!

  -Bºbuilt-in integration with many popular scientific packages includingº
   BºNumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, and others,º

  - features include:
    - pretty decent code editor: code completion, real-time code analysis.
    - interactive code execution that allows you to execute your code by line,
       by cell block, or run the entire file in a single go.
    - Static code analysis feature detects style issues, bad practices,
      potential bugs, and other quality problems in your code, without even
      having to actually execute it using ºPyLintº.
    - Debugger: It allows breakpoints and the execution flow to be viewed
                and controlled right from the Spyder GUI
    - Profiler:
    - basic Git version control system
    - History log pane records all commands introduced in the editor and IPython console
    - Help pane offers documentation about modules, classes, functions, and methods.
