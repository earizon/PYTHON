# What's New <!-- { --> 

### Python 3.12
- the interpreter can be operated in a special mode that integrates 
  with the Linux 'perf' profiler, a powerful tool with a robust 
  ecosystem, allowing Python functions to be visible in its output.

- PEP 684: Multi-threaded Parallelism!!!:
  Transitioning to a Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) per sub-interpreter. 
  Alongside, PEP 554 aims to allow the creation of subinterpreters 
  directly from Python, an attribute previously exclusive to the C API. 
  This change signifies the onset of genuine multi-threaded parallelism.
  It sets the venue for future innovations rather than offering 
  an immediate out-of-the-box solution.  Planned for a more tangible API 
  in Python 3.13.
