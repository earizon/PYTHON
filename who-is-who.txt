    Pocoo was a loosely assembled team of Open Source developers working on some
    very popular Python projects. Out of this came the Pygments syntax highlighter
    , the Sphinx documentation system, the Flask web framework, the Jinja
    templating engine, the Werkzeug WSGI library, the Click command line toolkit
    and much more. It was led by Armin Ronacher and Georg Brandl.
